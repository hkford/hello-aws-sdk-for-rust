# Hello AWS SDK for Rust

AWS SDK for Rust is [now generally available](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/11/aws-sdk-rust/). Also you can read [the release blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/announcing-general-availability-of-the-aws-sdk-for-rust/).

You can easily try out AWS SDK for Rust.

If this is the first time you are using an AWS SDK, you will need to set up your AWS credentials such as [short-term credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-authentication-short-term.html).

Just clone the repo and run the example program.

```term
$ git clone https://github.com/hkford/hello-aws-sdk-for-rust.git
$ cd hello-aws-sdk-for-rust
$ cargo run
```
